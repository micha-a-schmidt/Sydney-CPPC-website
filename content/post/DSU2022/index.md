The Dark Side of the Universe 2022 workshop will take place from 5th-9th December 2022 at The University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.  It will bring together a wide range of theorists and experimentalists to discuss current ideas on models of the dark sector of the Universe and to relate them to ongoing and future experiments.

The meeting will feature invited plenary talks covering topics of recent interest, as well as a number of parallel sessions to provide an opportunity for junior scientists to present their work.

See [https://indico.cern.ch/event/1107937/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1107937/) for the conference website. 

We look forward to seeing you in Sydney.
